# Autoencoder and Classification on CIFAR-10

## Project Overview

This project implements various neural network models for image reconstruction and classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It compares different pre-training techniques including Autoencoders, Masked Autoencoders, and Encoder-based classifiers. The goal is to explore the effectiveness of these models in image reconstruction and classification.

### Key Features:
- **Autoencoder Model** for image reconstruction
- **Encoder-based Classification** using the trained Encoder for feature extraction
- **Masked Autoencoder** for reconstructing masked patches from input images
- **Masked Autoencoder Classification** using a pre-trained Masked Autoencoder for classification tasks
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset** used for training and evaluation
